## Project Overview

**Hello World Demo** is a simple web application built with Flask that displays a "Hello World" message and includes a basic calculator with functionalities to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. The project is designed to demonstrate best practices in web development, automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end), and Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Flask Web Application:** Serves a static HTML page with a "Hello World" message and a functional calculator.
- **Calculator Functionality:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- **Automated Testing:**
  - **Unit Tests:** Verify individual calculator functions.
  - **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between Flask routes and calculator functions.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate user interactions with the web interface using Playwright.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated testing pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality on every commit and pull request.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Testing Frameworks:** Pytest, Playwright
- **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git** installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hello-world-demo.git
   cd hello-world-demo
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **On macOS and Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Upgrade `pip`**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Install Playwright Browsers**

   Playwright requires browser binaries to be installed.

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the Flask web application, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure the Virtual Environment is Activated**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the Flask Application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the "Hello World" message and use the calculator.

## Running Tests

The project includes three types of automated tests: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. Ensure that your virtual environment is activated before running any tests.

### Unit Tests

**Purpose:** Verify the correctness of individual calculator functions.

**Run Unit Tests:**

```bash
pytest tests/unit/
```

**Expected Output:**

All unit tests should pass without errors.

### Integration Tests

**Purpose:** Test the interaction between Flask routes and calculator functions.

**Run Integration Tests:**

```bash
pytest tests/integration/
```

**Expected Output:**

All integration tests should pass without errors.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Purpose:** Simulate user interactions with the web interface and verify the entire workflow.

**Run E2E Tests:**

```bash
pytest tests/e2e/
```

**Note:** The `flask_server` fixture automatically starts the Flask server before running E2E tests and shuts it down afterward.

**Expected Output:**

All E2E tests should pass, verifying the functionality of the web interface and calculator operations.

## Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

The project utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the testing process on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. This ensures that all tests pass before changes are merged, maintaining code quality and functionality.

### Workflow Configuration

The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/test.yml` and includes the following steps:

1. **Checkout Repository:** Uses the `actions/checkout` action to clone the repository.
2. **Set Up Python:** Uses the `actions/setup-python` action to set up the specified Python version.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Sets up a virtual environment, upgrades `pip`, installs project dependencies, and installs Playwright browsers.
4. **Run Unit Tests:** Executes all unit tests.
5. **Run Integration Tests:** Executes all integration tests.
6. **Run E2E Tests:** Executes all E2E tests, with the Flask server being managed by pytest fixtures.

### Monitoring CI Runs

1. **Navigate to Your GitHub Repository:**

   Open your repository in GitHub (e.g., [https://github.com/yourusername/hello-world-demo](https://github.com/yourusername/hello-world-demo)).

2. **Access the Actions Tab:**

   Click on the **Actions** tab to view all CI workflow runs.

3. **Review Test Results:**

   Ensure that all jobs (unit, integration, E2E) pass successfully. If any job fails, review the logs to identify and fix the issues.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or running the project, refer to the following troubleshooting steps.

### 1. `PytestUnknownMarkWarning: Unknown pytest.mark.e2e`

**Cause:** Pytest is not aware of the custom `e2e` marker.

**Solution:**

Ensure that the `pytest.ini` file exists in the project root with the following content:

```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    e2e: mark test as end-to-end test
```

### 2. `NameError: name 'sync_playwright' is not defined`

**Cause:** `sync_playwright` is not properly imported in `tests/conftest.py`.

**Solution:**

Ensure that `tests/conftest.py` includes the correct import statement:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
```

### 3. Flask Server Not Starting for E2E Tests

**Cause:** The Flask server isn't running when E2E tests execute.

**Solution:**

Ensure that the `flask_server` fixture is correctly defined and used in E2E tests.

**Verify `tests/conftest.py`:**

```python
import subprocess
import time
import pytest
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def flask_server():
    flask_process = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'app.py'])
    time.sleep(5)  # Adjust if necessary
    yield
    flask_process.terminate()
    flask_process.wait()

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def playwright_instance_fixture():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        yield p

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def browser(playwright_instance_fixture):
    browser = playwright_instance_fixture.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    yield browser
    browser.close()

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def page(browser):
    page = browser.new_page()
    yield page
    page.close()
```

**Ensure E2E Tests Use the Fixture:**

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.e2e
def test_hello_world(page, flask_server):
    # Test implementation

@pytest.mark.e2e
def test_calculator_add(page, flask_server):
    # Test implementation

@pytest.mark.e2e
def test_calculator_divide_by_zero(page, flask_server):
    # Test implementation
```

### 4. Port Conflicts

**Cause:** Another application is using port `5000`.

**Solution:**

- **Terminate Conflicting Processes:**

  ```bash
  pkill -f "python app.py"
  ```

- **Change Flask Port:**

  Modify `app.py` to run on a different port:

  ```python
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
  ```

  Update E2E tests accordingly:

  ```python
  page.goto('http://localhost:5001')
  ```

### 5. Playwright Not Installed Correctly

**Cause:** Playwright browsers aren't installed.

**Solution:**

Reinstall Playwright browsers:

```bash
playwright install
```

### 6. Virtual Environment Issues

**Cause:** Dependencies not recognized or virtual environment not activated.

**Solution:**

- **Activate Virtual Environment:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Reinstall Dependencies:**

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  playwright install
  ```
