# Agile User Stories for Hello World Calculator

## Initiative

**Provide Practical Learning Experiences for Students in Web Development and Agile Methodologies**

*Objective:* Equip students with hands-on experience in developing a web application using Agile practices, automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and continuous integration.

## Epic

**Develop a "Hello World" Web Application with Calculator Functionality Demonstrating Agile Practices and Automated Workflows**

*Description:* Create a web application that displays "Hello World" and includes a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, and divide functionalities. Implement automated tests using Playwright and pytest (covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), and set up GitHub Actions to run these tests automatically on code commits.

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 1: Set Up Project Repository

**As a** developer,  
**I want to** create a GitHub repository for the project,  
**so that** the project code is version-controlled and accessible for collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A new GitHub repository named `hello-world-calculator` is created.
- The repository contains a `README.md` with a project description.
- An appropriate `.gitignore` file is added to exclude unnecessary files and directories.
- The repository is initialized with a `main` branch.
- Local project files are pushed to the GitHub repository.

### User Story 2: Develop the HTML Page with Calculator

**As a** user,  
**I want to** view a web page that displays "Hello World" and includes a calculator,  
**so that** I can interact with basic web application functionalities.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- An `index.html` file is created within the `templates` directory.
- The HTML file includes a `<h1>` tag with the text "Hello World".
- The page features a calculator interface with input fields for two numbers and buttons for add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.
- Basic CSS styling is applied for visual clarity and user-friendly layout.
- The web page renders correctly in major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### User Story 3: Implement Calculator Functionality

**As a** developer,  
**I want to** implement backend functionalities for the calculator operations,  
**so that** users can perform calculations through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A `calculator.py` module is created containing functions for `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
- Flask routes are set up to handle POST requests for each calculator operation (`/add`, `/subtract`, `/multiply`, `/divide`).
- The backend correctly processes input data, performs calculations, and returns results in JSON format.
- Proper error handling is implemented, such as returning an error message when attempting to divide by zero.
- The frontend JavaScript correctly sends requests to the backend and displays the results or error messages.

### User Story 4: Implement Automated Testing with Playwright and pytest

**As a** tester,  
**I want to** write automated tests to verify the functionality of the calculator and the web application,  
**so that** I can ensure the application functions as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Written using pytest to test individual calculator functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) with various input scenarios, including positive and negative numbers.
  - Ensure that dividing by zero raises the appropriate error.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Written using pytest to test the interaction between Flask routes and calculator functions.
  - Verify that API endpoints return correct results and handle errors appropriately.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - Written using Playwright to simulate user interactions with the web interface.
  - Test scenarios include performing calculations and handling invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).
- All tests pass successfully, indicating that the application meets the defined functionalities and handles edge cases appropriately.

### User Story 5: Configure GitHub Actions for Continuous Testing

**As a** developer,  
**I want to** set up GitHub Actions to run automated tests on each commit,  
**so that** I can ensure code changes do not break the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) is created in the repository.
- The workflow is triggered on `push` and `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch.
- The workflow sets up the Python environment, installs dependencies, and initializes Playwright browsers.
- Automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) are executed as part of the workflow.
- The workflow reports test results, and if any test fails, the workflow fails, preventing the merge of breaking changes.
- Logs are accessible for debugging failed tests.

---

### User Story 6: Document the Development and Testing Process

**As a** student,  
**I want to** have clear documentation of the steps taken to develop and test the web application,  
**so that** I can understand the workflow and replicate it in future projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The `README.md` file includes sections for:
  - Project Overview
  - Features
  - Technology Stack
  - Setup and Installation
  - Running the Application
  - Running Tests (Unit, Integration, E2E)
  - Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
  - Project Structure
  - Troubleshooting
  - Contributing
  - License
- Instructions are provided for:
  - Cloning the repository
  - Setting up the virtual environment
  - Installing dependencies
  - Running the Flask application locally
  - Executing automated tests manually
  - Understanding the GitHub Actions workflow
- The documentation is clear, concise, and easy to follow for users with basic technical knowledge.

### User Story 7: Demonstrate Live Coding and Testing Workflow

**As an** instructor,  
**I want to** live code the development of the web application, implement tests, and show CI/CD in action,  
**so that** students can observe the entire Agile workflow in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A live coding session is planned to cover:
  - Setting up the project repository and environment.
  - Developing the HTML page with calculator functionality.
  - Writing and running unit, integration, and E2E tests.
  - Configuring GitHub Actions for continuous testing.
- The demonstration includes:
  - Committing code changes and pushing to GitHub.
  - Triggering the GitHub Actions workflow and observing test executions.
  - Reviewing test results and handling any failures.
- Students are engaged through explanations, Q&A, and interactive discussions during the process.
- Recording of the session is available for future reference and review.
